# Contributing

First off, thank you for being interested in contributing to this project and improving how we visualize quantum algorithms! 🚀

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that your code passes the lint check by running `npm run lint`. If it fails, you can fix them manually or run `npm run lint:fix`.
2. Test your code with `npm test` and ensure that all tests pass.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface (e.g. changes to Sqore API).
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
